            Brief Concept of Social Change
        </h2>      
        <h3> 
                Social change is a common feature of social reality that widely described and explained the evolution of human societies as well as the transformation in the basic components of human society right from the traditional to modern-day societies.
                There are alterations in social values, norms, institutions, relationships and stratification as a result of internal and external forces of social change.
                The external forces are events that occurred on a large scale, affecting an entire nation or several nations altogether such as climate change. 
                While internal forces are events that occurred on a small scale causing internal structural rearrangements with greater influences on the social fabric of the society, i.e. demographic change.
